**Updated pipeline and Methods for ITS2 rDNA Nanopore Amplicon Sequencing with Custom Barcodes**

This repo comprises two main components designed for the sequencing and analysis of human trichuriasis using nanopore technology used in the paper **"Nanopore-based analysis unravels the genetic landscape and phylogenetic placement of human-infecting Trichuris species in four LMIC countries with endemic trichuriasis"**. Analysis includes:

**Human Trichuriasis Nanopore Sequencing (ITS1/ITS2)** - Processing: This component is an amplicon processing pipeline for ITS1 and ITS2 sequencing.

**ITS2 Human trichuriasis post-processing**: This component is an R script designed to analyze the output data from the nanopore sequencing pipeline.

Together, These components provide a comprehensive workflow for processing, analyzing, and interpreting ITS1 and ITS2 sequencing data in studying human trichuriasis.

## Title: Nanopore-based analysis unravels the genetic landscape and phylogenetic placement of human-infecting Trichuris species in four LMIC countries with endemic trichuriasis

## Abstract
Soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), particularly trichuriasis, pose a significant global burden, affecting numerous mammalian hosts. Traditional diagnostic methods have struggled to differentiate species within the Trichuris genus, prompting the use of molecular techniques to understand the diversity and zoonotic transmission of Trichuris among humans and non-human primates (NHPs). In this study, we used nanopore-based full-length ITS2 rDNA sequencing to genetically characterize and resolve the phylogenetic placement of the newly identified human-infecting Trichuris hominis and the well-known Trichuris trichiura. Our multi-country trial in Ivory Coast, Laos, Tanzania, and Uganda, along with integrated data from other hosts, revealed 2 distinct clusters of Trichuris species of humans closely associated with taxonomically related host groups. We found that T. hominis and T. trichiura occur in specific ratios across countries and are also present in NHPs globally. Additionally, we demonstrated that ITS2 fragment length is a powerful diagnostic marker for distinguishing human-infecting Trichuris species. Future research should refine these diagnostic tools and explore additional genetic markers to better understand the evolutionary relationships within the Trichuris genus.
