**Updated pipeline and Methods for ITS2 rDNA Nanopore Amplicon Sequencing with Custom Barcodes**

This repo comprises two main components designed for the sequencing and analysis of human trichuriasis using nanopore technology:

**Human Trichuriasis Nanopore Sequencing (ITS1/ITS2)** - Processing: This component is an amplicon processing pipeline for ITS1 and ITS2 sequencing.
**ITS2 Human trichuriasis post-processing**: This component is an R script designed to analyze the output data from the nanopore sequencing pipeline.
These components together provide a comprehensive workflow for processing, analyzing, and interpreting ITS1 and ITS2 sequencing data in the study of human trichuriasis.
